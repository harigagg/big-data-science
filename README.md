This post aims at modeling the prices of Airbnb apartments in Toronto. In other words, the aim is to build our own price suggestion model. The data used in this post has been downloaded from the http://insideairbnb.com/ website and was collected in June 2019. This work is inspired from the Airbnb price prediction model built by Dino Rodriguez, Chase Davis, and Ayomide Opeyemi.

This post contains two main parts:

the data preprocessing, which aims at cleaning the data and selecting the most useful features for the models.
the modelling with 3 different algorithms: Random Forests, Gradient Boost Regression, Decision Trees and Linear Regression models.

This entire Project has been done in Databricks using PySpark.
